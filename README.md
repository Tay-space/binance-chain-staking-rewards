# Binance Chain Staking Rewards

[https://aprea.github.io/binance-chain-staking-rewards/](https://aprea.github.io/binance-chain-staking-rewards/)

You can use this website to export your [Binance Chain Staking](https://www.bnbchain.world/en/staking) rewards to a file in the CSV file format.

The CSV file uses [Koinly's custom CSV format](https://help.koinly.io/en/articles/3662999-how-to-create-a-custom-csv-file-with-your-data) but can be easily adapted to other formats to make it compatible with alternative cryptocurrency tax services.

## Usage

* Enter your Binance Chain Network address (starting with "bnb") into the input field.
* Click the "Export transactions to CSV" button.

You will be presented with a CSV download containing the full Binance Chain Staking reward history for the given address.

## Is this safe to use?

To put it simply, yes.

* It's not possible to perform a meaningful attack with only a public address.
* The code for this website is open source and can be viewed in full via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aprea/binance-chain-staking-rewards).
* The export process takes place in client, i.e. no data is sent back to the server. In fact, this website is hosted on GitHub pages which doesn't provide access to the backend server.
